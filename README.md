# Base Page for Imaginary Festival

Welcome to the repository for the Base Page of the imaginary festival, a project completed as part of my 3rd semester exam.

## Project Overview

This project involved creating the main landing page for an imaginary festival, which links to various sections of the festival's website, including the Ticket Flow page. The base page was designed to provide an engaging and intuitive user experience, guiding visitors through the festival's offerings.

## Features

- **Next.js Integration**: Utilized Next.js for server-side rendering and optimized performance.
- **Main Landing Page**: Serves as the central hub for all festival-related information and links to other pages, including the Ticket Flow page.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensuring a seamless experience across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and modern design to enhance user experience.
- **Interactive Elements**: Engaging features to keep users informed and interested.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For building a fast, server-side rendered React application.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For structure and styling of the webpage.
- **JavaScript**: To add interactivity and dynamic content.

## Contributions

While I primarily focused on bug fixing for this part of the project, the main development was handled by my groupmates:
- [Lasse](https://github.com/LasseVestergaard95)
- [Katrine](https://github.com/katbang)

The Base Page also links to the [Ticket Flow page](https://github.com/marhjo/Festival-Ticketflow), which I developed as a solo endeavor.
